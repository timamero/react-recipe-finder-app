# Recipe Finder Application
*This project is in development*

Recipe finder is an application that allows a user to search for recipes by cuisine or ingredients. The user can view a list of results or can let the app randomly select a recipe. The user can skip/swipe through random recipes. Users with an account will be able to save recipes.

Recipe data will be fetched from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
